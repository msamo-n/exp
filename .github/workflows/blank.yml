# This is a basic workflow to help you get started with Actions

name: CI

# Controls when the workflow will run
on:
  # Triggers the workflow on push or pull request events but only for the "main" branch
  push:
    branches: [ "main" ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ "main" ]

  # Allows you to run this workflow manually from the Actions tab
  workflow_dispatch:

# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel
jobs:

  job1:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    # Map a step output to a job output
    outputs:
      apply_matrix: ${{ steps.check.outputs.matrix }}
    steps:
      - run: |
          echo '${{ toJSON(github) }}'
      - id: check
        run: |          
          echo 'matrix={"include":[{"platform":"scylla","version":"0057"},{"platform":"charybdis","version":"0056"}]}' >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT
          echo "DRY RUN: ${{ github.event_name != 'push' }}"

  job2:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    needs: job1
    if: needs.job1.outputs.apply_matrix != ''
    strategy:
      matrix: ${{ fromJSON(needs.job1.outputs.apply_matrix) }}
    steps:
      - run: |
          echo "PLATFORM=${{ matrix.platform }}"
          echo "VERSION=${{ matrix.version }}"
          echo "${{ toJSON(matrix) }}"
          exit -1

  conclusion:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    needs: [job1, job2]
    steps:
